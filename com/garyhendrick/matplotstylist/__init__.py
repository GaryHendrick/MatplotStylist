""" Note repaired matplotstylist.py so that its launcher methods do not leave an abandoned thread upon exit
    This was accomplished by having the application subclass Frame and by not creating a root explicitly,
    in direct opposition to most applications"""
""" DONE: change naming conventions to better describe the use case for this project
        - gone to "stylist" naming convention"""
